<th><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZF5VAfcvl101ZujAkJJDFPKr4mIId0w8/preview">System Design</a></th>
<td>At the end of Unit 7, I submitted my System Design for my driverless car program. The System Design project required me to identify three operations I wished to support in my program, as well as the capability for my program to retain data from the data structures of stacks, lists, queues, and dictionaries. To support the proposal for my software design, I was also required to include UML diagrams: use case, activity, class, sequence, and state transition diagrams. In order to complete this project, I first had to conduct a thorough analysis of the requirements and constraints of a basic self-driving car. In other words, I had to ask myself the question of “What makes a self-driving car?”. To answer this question, I researched and analyzed existing self-driving car systems to understand their functionality and design, and then developed my System Design around those requirements and restraints. Upon submitting my project at the end of Unit 7, there is one thing I could have done better in: my UML diagrams. I particularly struggled with my Activity Diagram and State-Transition Diagram because both require a certain level of abstraction and a different way of thinking about my proposed system’s behavior.

<th>Collaborative Discussion 1 Summary</th>
<td> In Collaborative Discussion 1, I discussed the article by Padhy et al. (2018) on the reusability of object-oriented software and identified the 6 most important factors that influence its reusability. These include the requirement analysis, knowledge requirement, algorithms used in the program, architecture-driven approach, documentation in the project, and design patterns.  I also listed five factors as the least important factors influencing the reusability of object-oriented software, including the modules used in the data project, modules in the project and program, test cases, and service contracts.
I found this discussion to be important because it made me gain valuable insights as to what I can prioritize as both a student and future software developer to make my programs reusable, efficient, and cost-effective. This discussion encouraged me to think beyond coding itself and consider in a broader context in which my software will be used.</td>

<th>Collaborative Discussion Post 2 Summary </th>
<td>In Collaborative Discussion 2, I discussed the benefits of designing a metamodel to support the development of smart car, as well as object-oriented IoT systems. I was able to highlight the strengths of metamodeling, such as reducing the computational burden, simplifying the design process, and enabling collaboration through standardization. I also identified some of the weaknesses, such as the complexity of the metamodel and the difficulty in achieving standardization. This discussion is important because understanding the strengths and weaknesses of software development approaches is crucial for future software developers such as myself. Being aware of the strengths of metamodeling would allow developers to recognize how to create more efficient models, while at the same time being aware of the drawbacks.</td>
