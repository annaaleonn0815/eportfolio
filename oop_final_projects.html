<td>At the end of Unit 7, I submitted my System Design for my driverless car program. The System Design project required me to identify three operations I wished to support in my program, as well as the capability for my program to retain data from the data structures of stacks, lists, queues, and dictionaries. To support the proposal for my software design, I was also required to include UML diagrams: use case, activity, class, sequence, and state transition diagrams. In order to complete this project, I first had to conduct a thorough analysis of the requirements and constraints of a basic self-driving car. In other words, I had to ask myself the question of “What makes a self-driving car?”. To answer this question, I researched and analyzed existing self-driving car systems to understand their functionality and design, and then developed my System Design around those requirements and restraints. Upon submitting my project at the end of Unit 7, there is one thing I could have done better in: my UML diagrams. I particularly struggled with my Activity Diagram and State-Transition Diagram because both require a certain level of abstraction and a different way of thinking about my proposed system’s behavior.

<th><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pW4ljdFnpGcrbCx53xk8jycUcfStPVkL/preview">System Implementation</a></th>
<td>At the end of Unit 11, I submitted my System Implementation project. This project was a continuation of the System Design project, except this project included the actual code itself as well as a README file containing instructions on how to execute the code. In comparison to the project I submitted in Unit 7, this project needed to provide solutions to the questions and ideas raised in the previous project: creating a program representing a self-driving car able to manually maneuver, start and stop, and detect obstacles. Now that I have already completed significant amounts of research on the operations and components of a driverless car (such as object detection, asynchronous navigation, route planning, etc.), the only thing I needed to do was apply my knowledge of object-oriented principles to my code. To start off, I had to ask myself the question of “How does the software architecture of existing self-driving cars utilize object-oriented programming and what can I use to apply to my own software?”. After completing and submitting my System Implementation project, I noticed that one area of improvement is the readability of my code. Although I utilized good object-oriented practices, there are some sections of the code that could have been more clearly labeled to make it easier to follow.
