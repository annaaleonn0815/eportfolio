									<p>  In this Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module, I have gained a deeper understanding of the key concepts and principles of this programming paradigm, which has greatly impacted my personal and professional development. One of the key aspects of this module was learning about the four pillars of OOP, specifically encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. My learning of these four pillars is evidenced in my work in Unit 1-- in this unit, the most significant work I completed was the Introduction to Python and Object-Oriented Programming Philosophy Lecturecast. This activity was important because not only did it introduce the principles of OOP that I would soon carry with me throughout this course, but it also presented challenges associated with it. One of the main challenges I learned about in this lecturecast and struggled with myself in this module is creating effective class hierarchies (Phillips, 2018). As this was my first exposure to this approach of programming, completing this specific lecturecast along with its review tests was a little overwhelming; it was difficult for me to conceptualize these abstract concepts in my head without seeing a tangible example. However, upon completing this unit, I was able to gain a solid understanding by applying basic OOP concepts in coding exercises such as the Protected and Unprotected Variables Exercise. For example, I was able to apply methods such as encapsulation and inheritance through the bundling of data and methods into clearly defined classes (Phillips, 2018). Throughout units 1-3, I then gained a better understanding of polymorphism and abstraction. Learning these key concepts proved to be crucial to my learning experience because they applied to every single piece of work that I submitted throughout this module. Starting in Unit 3 and ending in Unit 4, we learned about the Unified Modeling Language (UML) UML provides a standardized way to represent different aspects of a system, such as its structure, behavior, and interactions (Rumbaugh et al., 2004). This part of the module was personally the most difficult concept for me to learn throughout the entire module-- UML  may seem straightforward, but I found that it was challenging to be able to technically communicate the details of a software system. However, one thing that helped me overcome this is the constant practice this module provided me. For example, the Unit 4 Seminar Preparation required me to write a Python program that implements the proposed software in a Class Diagram that I created. In addition, I made a significant effort to complete the unit reading, so that I can better understand the theoretical aspects of UML. Taking these steps to improve has taught me to think critically about the structure of my code and ultimately increase the efficiency of my software development.<br>
									<br> Unit 5 and 6 involved a great deal of hands-on experience in OOP. Instead of learning the definitions of OOP coding concepts, I began applying the theories I learned at the beginning of the module to actual code. For example, in the Codio Inheritance exercise, I was prompted to create a program using OOP representing a deck of cards that initializes the deck with 52 cards and has two parameters: the number of hands and number of hands and the number of hands per card. This assignment required me to have a good grasp on what it means to inherit attributes from an existing class. To show my understanding, the Deck class inherits from the Card class. Codio projects such as this one helped me to visualize what OOP looks like in Python. The Codio exercises throughout the module played an essential part in forming my ability to write modular, reusable code. In the future, when working in the field of Computer Science after graduating, this skill will help me maintain and update easy-to-read software. The later units of this module-- from Unit 7 to 12-- taught me to thoroughly test my code. One concept that stood out during this part of the module was writing and executing test cases such as unittest. Learning testing in Python was easy for me to grasp, as Python has a built-in test module (Pezze & Young, 2008). Learning this aspect of coding in OOP is important because it taught me to identify errors and defects in my code before submitting my work.<br>
									<br> Itâ€™s important to note, however, that this module did not only teach me the hard skills necessary to work in Computer Science but also taught me soft skills such as teamwork. This is evidenced in my Collaborative Discussion 1 and 2, where I created multiple posts regarding varying topics of OOP. These discussions allowed me to receive and give constructive criticism.<br>
									<br> Every skill I learned in this module will help me in the future as a developer by preventing and detecting bugs in my software, which will allow me to write reliable code. Every skill I have learned in this module is evidenced in my System Design and System Implementation final projects, which required me to first design a driverless car program. I chose the three main operations to be starting/stopping, synchronous driving, and obstacle detection. The System Design project then contained the code and a README file explaining how to execute it. While completing these projects, I used my knowledge of UML diagrams and the four pillars of OOP by creating two classes: DriverlessCar and SelfDrivingCar, using the data structures of list, stack, queue, and dictionary. Creating these two final projects was both consuming and stressful because fixing bugs and errors took up most of my time.<br>
									<br> Overall, these skills have aided in my personal and professional development. As a student who aspired to work in creative computing, OOP is an extremely valuable skill to have; it can be applied to developing complex software systems that require rapid prototyping and testing (Lethbridge & Laganiere, 2006). Adding OOP to my skillset will help me become more competitive as a future developer.
