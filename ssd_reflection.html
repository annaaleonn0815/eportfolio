									<p>  Throughout the Secure Software Development module, I undertook a diverse range of assignments that collectively enhanced my understanding and practical application of the principles of secure software development. From the start of the module, I realised the importance of integrating security considerations into every phase of the software development life cycle. Identifying vulnerabilities and threats early on is crucial, as it allows for the implementation of appropriate security measures to mitigate risks.<br>
									<br> The first main principle that I learned in Units 1-3 was the concept of security vulnerabilities. As someone who has never learned about the different kinds of security vulnerabilities that result from software development, it took me time to memorise the different vulnerabilities and their definitions. Collaborative Discussion 1 was extremely helpful in helping me learn about the different kinds of vulnerabilities. For this discussion post, I chose to analyse Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), in which an attacker injects malicious code and is then able to manipulate a user’s web page and even perform actions without their consent Sulatycki & Fernández, 2015. Another artefact that aided my learning about security vulnerabilities was the Unit 1 Blog Post. This activity required me to read the ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions and develop an argument on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside. I chose: Risk assessment, Access control, Confidentiality, Audit, and Information Security as the five most relevant cyber security terms to manage people (ISO/IEC, 2018). Activities such as this one were crucial in teaching me not only the security risks that arise from software development, but also ways to mitigate these vulnerabilities.<br>
									<br> To build off of the vulnerabilities taught in the first 3 units of the module, Units 4-6 of this module focused on secure coding practices. Like a Software Developer, this module emphasised the importance of secure coding techniques in order to mitigate security vulnerabilities. For example, I completed various Codio Activities that spanned the topics of Python tools and features as well as testing with Python. These activities were important because they helped me refine my skills in writing clear, effective code in Python. In addition, the lessons from these activities were applicable to every assignment I was required to complete throughout the molecule, as python libraries and commands as well as testing is required in ensuring that code is secure. For example, by conducting thorough security testing, developers such as myself can identify and address security flaws early in the development process (ISO/IEC, 2018). In addition, testing ensures that security mechanisms are working correctly and effectively.<br>
									<br> Lastly, Units 7-11 focused on concepts such as recursion and cryptography. For example, in the Seminar 4 Preparation, I learned how to create a python program that can take a short piece of text and encrypt it. These principles of Secure Software Development are important for my overall progress into the field of software development because having an understanding of these concepts would help with the simplicity and readability of any code I write in the future.<br>
                  <br> Not only were there various coding assignments that provided me with valuable hands-on experience in coding secure programs in Python, but this module also required a significant amount of teamwork. All of the final projects submitted in this module--the System Design Project and the Final Coding Output Project--were done in teams. Working in a team of four members, both the System Design Project and the Final Coding Output Project required us to position ourselves as IT Software Consultants and Developers for developing an app that provides a secure repository for an organisation of our choice. In this instance, my team chose to build a secure repository for the Dutch Police Internet Forensics organisation. Despite living in different time zones, each of us consistently met every week to draft an application that supported access via web browser, abided GDPR regulations, and was able to perform CRUD functions. While creating our design document and later the code used to create the app, we used many of the concepts we learned earlier in the module: we proposed software that was thoroughly tested, accounted for user authorization and authentication, as well as security features such as session timeouts, data encryption, and event monitoring. Compared to the Design Document, there were three changes our team made within the Coding Output project. First, we changed the frontend framework from React to Django because not every member of our team was not familiar with React, and Django is Python-based. As a result, the second change we made to our application was changing our proposed use of PostgreSQL and SQLite, as SQLite is supported by Django. Lastly, we chose to have our application run locally instead of remotely because we wanted it to run on the user’s machine.<br>
                  <br> Overall, this module equipped me with a strong understanding of secure software development principles, methodologies, and best practices that I can bring into my future career in the Computer Science field. I now have the necessary skills to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities, implement secure coding techniques, and adhere to industry standards. It is important to have these skills because as cybersecurity concerns continue to grow, employers are increasingly seeking developers who prioritise security (Craigen et al., 2014). Completing this module demonstrates my commitment to secure software practices, making me a competitive candidate in the job market. Additionally, with the ability to proactively address security risks, I am now better equipped to develop resilient and secure software applications. The fact that I had hands-on experience working in a team throughout this module proves that I have the teamwork and effective communication skills to work in the software development industry.<br>
